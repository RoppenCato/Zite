# arrive_shop: arriving at a shop: a shop door's jingle: three small bells shaken, a wooden knock of the door.
# The UI set's second half (Miles, GD's name ui/arrive-shop; docs/sound-demands.md, wave 1). Recorded wood, leather, water and metal from the Survival studio,
# bells and strings the studio's, in C pentatonic. Written by sfx/ui/_make2.py; change it there.
