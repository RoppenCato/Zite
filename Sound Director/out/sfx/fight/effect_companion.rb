# effect_companion: a companion joins: a little two-note whistle, a friendly hello.
# The fight sprite (Miles, GD's name fight/effect-companion). Layers from the Survival game's recordings, its picks first (docs/survival-library.md);
# the bells and strings are the studio's. Written by sfx/fight/_make.py; change it there.
