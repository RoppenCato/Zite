# Miles, GD's brief (docs/sound-demands.md, wave 1; the game's name ui/chest-ding). Enchanted Kingdoms: storybook, wood and bells, short,
# never piercing. Recorded wood for every knock (sfx/ui/ref/README.md); bells are the studio's pretty bell, the one synth voice Robin
# has liked, in C pentatonic so they sit over any region's key. Written by sfx/ui/_make.py; change it there.
